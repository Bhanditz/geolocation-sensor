      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        Use cases can roughly be grouped in four categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Foreground</strong> operations:
          <ul>
            <li>Getting a <strong>one-off geolocation update</strong>.</li>
            <li>Getting <strong>continuous geolocation updates</strong> (aka. geotracking).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Background</strong> operations:
          <ul>
            <li>Getting <strong>continuous geolocation updates</strong> (aka. geotracking).</li>
            <li>Getting a <strong>one-off geolocation fence alert</strong> (aka. geofencing).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Core constraints when obtaining gelocation are <strong>accuracy</strong>
        (<em>how close to the actual position of the user is the determined position</em>) and
        <strong>latency</strong> (<em>how long does the user want to wait for a result</em>).
        Both are tradeoffs: one can trade faster results for lower accuracy and vice versa.
        A common theme is to first obtain a rough estimation that then gets refined,
        for example based initially on surrounding WiFi signals (which is fast to obtain)
        and then eventually based on precise GPS data (which may take some time to find a signal).

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
        In the following, we list use cases based on the previously defined categories.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Foreground—One-off geolocation update</h3>

        <section id="usecase_social_networking">
          <h4>Location-tagged status updates in social networking applications</h4>

          <p>
            A social network application allows its users to automatically tag their
            status updates with location information. It does this by monitoring the
            user's position with the Geolocation Sensor API. Each user can control the
            granularity of the location information (e.g. city or neighborhood level)
            that is shared with the other users. Any user can also track his network
            of friends and get real-time updates about their current location.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usecase_find_poi">
          <h4>Find points of interest in the user's area</h4>
          <p>
            Someone visiting a foreign city could access a web application that
            allows users to search or browse through a database of tourist
            attractions. Using the Geolocation Sensor API, the web application has access to
            the user's approximate position and it is therefore able to rank the
            search results by proximity to the user's location.
          </p>
        </section>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Foreground—Continuous geolocation updates</h3>

        <section id="usecase_local_info">
          <h4>Up-to-date local information</h4>

          <p>
            A widget-like web application that shows the weather or news that are
            relevant to the user's current area can use the Geolocation Sensor API to
            register for location updates. If the user's position changes, the widget
            can adapt the content accordingly.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usecase_poi_alert">
          <h4>Alerts when points of interest are in the user's vicinity</h4>

          <p>
            A tour-guide web application can use the Geolocation Sensor API to monitor the
            user's position and trigger visual or audio notifications when interesting
            places are in the vicinity. An online task management system can trigger
            reminders when the user is in the proximity of landmarks that are
            associated with certain tasks.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usecase_show_position">
          <h4>Show the user's position on a map</h4>

          <p>
            A user finds themselves in an unfamiliar city area. They want to check their
            position so they use their handheld device to navigate to a web-based
            mapping application that can pinpoint their exact location on the city map
            using the Geolocation Sensor API. They then ask the web application to provide
            driving directions from their current position to their desired destination.
          </p>
        </section>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Background—Continuous geolocation updates</h3>

        <section id="usecase_turn_by_turn">
          <h4>Turn-by-turn route navigation</h4>

          <p>
            A mapping application can help the user navigate along a route by
            providing detailed turn-by-turn directions. The application does this by
            registering with the Geolocation Sensor API to receive repeated location updates
            of the user's position. These updates are delivered as soon as the
            implementing user agent determines that the position of the user has
            changed, which allows the application to anticipate any changes of
            direction that the user might need to do.
            The application can be in the foreground, but likewise can be backgrounded,
            for example, when the user turns their device off to save battery
            on a long highway route section without side roads.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Tracking sports activity</h4>

          <p>
            A web application can track a user's sports activity, for example,
            a marathon run or a bicycle race. Therefore, the application does not
            need to be on the screen, but would be backgrounded while the user
            performs their activity, maybe with their handheld device strapped to their arm.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usecase_content_annotation">
          <h4>Annotating content with location information</h4>

          <p>
            A group of friends is hiking through the Scottish highlands. Some of
            them write short notes and take pictures at various points throughout the
            journey and store them using a web application that can work offline on
            their handheld devices. Whenever they add new content, the application
            automatically tags it with location data from the Geolocation Sensor API (which,
            in turn, uses the on-board GPS device). Every time they reach a town or a
            village, and they are again within network coverage, the application
            automatically uploads their notes and pictures to a popular blogging website,
            which uses the geolocation data to construct links that point to a
            mapping service. Users who follow the group's trip can click on these
            links to see a satellite view of the area where the notes were written and
            the pictures were taken. Another example is a life blog where a user
            creates content (e.g., images, video, audio) that records their every day
            experiences. This content can be automatically annotated with information
            such as time, geographic position or even the user's emotional state at
            the time of the recording.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Real estate search</h4>
          <p>
            A web application on a handheld device can notify a user of interesting
            available properties in a neighborhood they are passing by where the property
            fits the user's previously specified search criteria, for example,
            3 bedroom apartments with balcony.
          </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Background—One-off geolocation fence alert</h3>

        <section>
          <h4>Retail special offers</h4>
          <p>
            Given their previous consent, a user with a retailer's web application
            installed on their handheld device can be alerted about special offers
            or location-based coupons when they are in vicinity of a physical presence of the retailer.
            Further, the in-store experience can be enriched, for example, the
            retailer can let the user know something they have looked at before
            is actually available for pick up nearby.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Reminder and to-do applications</h4>
          <p>
            Reminder and to-do web applications can use a geofence to remind the
            user to do something when they cross it, for example, to buy milk
            when they are near the supermarket.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Travel applications</h4>
          <p>
            Travel applications can show venue specific data like WiFi passwords,
            the user's booking confirmation etc. only within geofence boundaries.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Ticketing or booking confirmations</h4>
          <p>
            Ticketing or booking applications can bring up a ticket notification with a QR
            or bar code once the user is near the venue of a concert or sports event
            or when they reach their rental car counter or similar.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Ride share applications</h4>
          <p>
            Users can be informed if their designated driver reaches a pre-defined pickup point.
