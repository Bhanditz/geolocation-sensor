        This document provides a collection of use cases and usage scenarios for
        web pages and applications that rely on Geolocation Sensor data.

        This document provides informative background to the
        <a href="http://w3c.github.io/geolocation-sensor/index.html">Geolocation Sensor specification</a>.
        Comments on the document should be filed as issues at

    <section id="terminology" class="informative">
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        The mentioned use cases can roughly be grouped into four categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Foreground</strong> operations:
          <ul>
            <li>Getting a <strong>one-off geolocation update</strong>.</li>
            <li>Getting <strong>continuous geolocation updates</strong> (<em>aka.</em> foreground geotracking).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Background</strong> operations:
          <ul>
            <li>Getting <strong>continuous geolocation updates</strong> (<em>aka.</em> background geotracking).</li>
            <li>Getting a <strong>one-off geolocation fence alert</strong> (<em>aka.</em> background geofencing).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Core constraints when obtaining the gelocation are <strong>accuracy</strong>
        (<em>how close to the actual position of the user is the determined position</em>) and
        <strong>latency</strong> (<em>how long does the user want to wait for a result</em>).
        Both are tradeoffs: one can trade faster results for lower accuracy and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        A common theme is to first obtain a rough estimation that then gets refined over time,
        for example based initially on surrounding WiFi signals (which is fast to obtain)
        and then eventually based on precise GPS data (which may take some time to find a signal).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="use_cases" class="informative">
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
        In the following, we list use cases based on the previously defined categories.
        We note that the categories are not mutually exclusive and that overlaps exist.
        A task might start in the foreground, then continue in the background
        (for example, while the user quickly responds to an incoming email), and then eventually
        terminate in the foreground when the user multitasks back.
      </p>

      <section id="usecases_oneoff_foreground">
        <h3>Foreground—One-off geolocation update</h3>

        <section id="usecases_whereami">
          <h4>Locate a user on a map</h4>
          <p>
            A mapping application can use the Geolocation Sensor API data of a user
            to locate them on the map, essentially responding to the question
            "Where am I right now?"
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usecase_find_poi">
          <h4>Find points of interest in the user's area</h4>
          <p>
            Someone visiting a foreign city could access a web application that
            allows users to search or browse through a database of tourist
            attractions. Using the Geolocation Sensor API, the web application has access to
            the user's approximate current position and is therefore able to rank the
            search results by proximity to the user's location.
          </p>
        </section>

      </section>

      <section id="usecases_continuous_foreground">
        <h3>Foreground—Continuous geolocation updates</h3>

        <section id="usecase_local_info">
          <h4>Up-to-date local information</h4>

          <p>
            A widget-like web application that shows the weather or news that are
            relevant to the user's current area can use the Geolocation Sensor API to
            register for location updates. If the user's position changes, the widget
            can adapt the content accordingly.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usecase_poi_alert">
          <h4>Alerts when points of interest are in the user's vicinity</h4>

          <p>
            A tour guide web application can use the Geolocation Sensor API to monitor the
            user's position and trigger visual or audio notifications when interesting
            places are in the vicinity. An online task management system can trigger
            reminders when the user is in the proximity of landmarks that are
            associated with certain tasks.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usecase_show_position">
          <h4>Show the user's position on a map</h4>

          <p>
            A user finds themselves in an unfamiliar area. They want to check their
            position so they use their handheld device to navigate to a web-based
            mapping application that can pinpoint their exact location on the map
            using the Geolocation Sensor API. They then ask the web application to provide
            driving directions from their current position to their desired destination,
            essentially responding to the question "Where am I going?".
          </p>
        </section>

      </section>

      <section id="usecases_continuous_background">
        <h3>Background—Continuous geolocation updates</h3>

        <section id="usecase_social_networking">
          <h4>Location-tagged status updates in social networking applications</h4>

          <p>
            A social networking application allows its users to automatically tag their
            status updates with location information. It does this by monitoring the
            user's position with the Geolocation Sensor API. Each user can control the
            granularity of the location information (e.g., city or neighborhood level)
            that is shared with the other users. Any user can also see their network
            of friends and get real-time updates about their current location,
            granted they have opted in to their location data being shared.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usecase_turn_by_turn">
          <h4>Turn-by-turn route navigation</h4>

          <p>
            A mapping application can help the user navigate along a route by
            providing detailed turn-by-turn directions. The application does this by
            registering with the Geolocation Sensor API to receive repeated location updates
            of the user's position. These updates are delivered as soon as the
            implementing user agent determines that the position of the user has
            changed, which allows the application to anticipate any changes of
            direction that the user might need to do.
            The application can be in the foreground, but likewise can be backgrounded,
            for example, when the user turns their device off to save battery
            on a long highway route section without side roads.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usecase_sports_tracking">
          <h4>Tracking sports activity</h4>

          <p>
            A web application can track a user's sports activity, for example,
            a marathon run or a bicycle race. Therefore, the application does not
            need to be on the screen, but would be backgrounded while the user
            performs their activity, maybe with their handheld device strapped to their arm.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usecase_real_estate">
          <h4>Real estate search</h4>
          <p>
            A web application on a handheld device can notify a user of interesting
            available properties in a neighborhood they are passing by where the property
            fits the user's previously specified search criteria, for example,
            3&nbsp;bedroom apartments with balcony.
          </p>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section id="usecases_geofencing">
        <h3>Background—One-off geolocation fence alert</h3>

        <section id="usecase_reminder">
          <h4>Reminder and to-do applications</h4>
          <p>
            Reminder and to-do web applications can use a geofence to remind the
            user to do something when they cross it, for example, to buy milk
            when they are near the supermarket.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usecase_travel">
          <h4>Travel applications</h4>
          <p>
            Travel applications can show venue specific data like WiFi passwords,
            the user's booking confirmation etc. only within geofence boundaries.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usecase_ticketing">
          <h4>Ticketing or booking confirmations</h4>
          <p>
            Ticketing or booking applications can bring up a ticket notification with a QR
            or bar code once the user is near the venue of a concert or sports event
            or when they reach their rental car counter or similar.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usecase_ride_share">
          <h4>Ride share applications</h4>
          <p>
            Users can be informed if their designated driver reaches a pre-defined pickup point.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usecase_retail">
          <h4>Retail special offers</h4>
          <p>
            Given their previous consent, a user with a retailer's web application
            installed on their handheld device can be alerted about special offers
            or location-based coupons when they are in vicinity of a physical presence of the retailer.
            Further, the in-store experience can be enriched, for example, the
            retailer can let the user know something they have looked at before
            is actually available for pick up nearby.
